A way to manage config files (dotfiles)

I have no clue how I am gonna implement this...

## Plan or something idk
+ Have a file for dependencies
+ Be able to specify wether the "config" is to be compiled from scratch (Eg: DWM) or have some config files which are to be placed in a specific directory (Eg: i3)
+ Have a file listing all the stuff which will be compiled/configured, also have links to their respective git repositories hosted on github, gitlab (Basically anywhere accessible directly by `git clone <link>`)
+ Log all the changes (installing/compiling/configuring)
